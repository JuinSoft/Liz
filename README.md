### Detailed Description
Liz is a decentralized lending platform built on the CrossFi blockchain. It allows users to request loans and lend funds to others based on their credit score, which is dynamically calculated using on-chain activity.

### Key Features:
- **Borrowing:** Users can request loans by specifying the amount and duration. The interest rate is determined by their credit score.
- **Lending:** Lenders can browse available loan requests and choose to fund them. Higher credit scores indicate lower risk.
- **Credit Scores:** Each user has a credit score that is updated based on their lending and borrowing activity. Repaying loans on time increases the score, while defaults lower it.
- **Decentralization:** The platform operates through smart contracts, ensuring transparency and eliminating the need for intermediaries.

### Technologies Used:
- React for the frontend
- CrossFi Blockchain
- Solidity for smart contracts
- Ethers.js for blockchain interaction
- Covalent API for data aggregation

By providing a transparent and accessible lending market, Liz aims to democratize access to credit and enable more efficient allocation of capital.
